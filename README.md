# Hodgkin-Huxley
Basic implementations of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations that describe electrical cell activations. There is a basic (one cell) version as well as a connected fiber (a string of cells) and a loop of cells. The loop is set up to create an infinite current loop. Implementations are provided in Matlab and Python.
